Hello and welcome to my animation lab. Note that this is not a traditional animation rather a collection of scenes that tend to express a certain atmosphere.

As there are many aspects of what causes certain atmosphere, I will be focusing on following elements (this might get updated):
* Music.
* Light.
* Color.
* Natural light timeframe.
* Background story.
* Scene background.
* FX.
* Aspect ratio.

All materials are in the wiki tab: https://github.com/lorentzo/Animation/wiki.
